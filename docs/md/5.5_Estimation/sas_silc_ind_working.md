## silc_ind_working {#sas_silc_ind_working}
Create a working copy of a given indicator, possibly including already calculated values for other 
countries during the same year.

	%silc_ind_working(idsn, odsn, time=, geo=, ilib=);

### Arguments
* `idsn` : an input dataset reference;
* `time` : (_option_) period (year) of interest; default: empty;
* `geo` : (_option_) unformatted (blank separated) list of country/geographical area of interest; 
	when filled as a geographical area, all countries already present in the table are retrieved; 
	default: empty, and the structure of the input table `idsn` is simply used as a template for `odsn`;
* `ilib` : (_option_) name of the input library; by default: empty, _i.e._ `WORK` is used.
  
### Returns
`odsn` : name of the output dataset (in `WORK` library) where a copy of the original indicator or its
	structure is stored.

### Examples
When dealing with EU-SILC datasets and considering the already existing indicator `LI01` as an input
source dataset, you can run the commands:

	libname rdb "&G_PING_C_RDB";
	%silc_ind_working(LI01, dsn, ilib=rdb);

so as to create, in `WORK` library, the dataset `dsn` that is initialised with the following table: 
| geo | time | indic_il  | hhtyp       | currency | ivalue       | iflag | unrel | lastup  | lastuser |
|-----|------|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------|-------|---------|----------|
|     |      |           |             |          |              |       |       |         |          |
hence, `dsn` is shaped like `LI01`.

If instead, your run (still using the same indicator as a source table):

	%silc_ind_working(LI01, dsn, geo=AT BE EU28, time=2015, ilib=rdb);

the dataset `dsn` created in `WORK` library will this time look like this:
geo | time | indic_il  | hhtyp       | currency | ivalue       | iflag | unrel | lastup  | lastuser
----|------|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------|-------|---------|---------
LV	| 2015 | LI_C_MD60 | A1          | NAC      | 3497.0429508 | .     | 0     | 03FEB16 | pillapa

... | .....|    ...    |    ...      | ...      |      ...     | ...   | ...   |   ...   |   ...
where observations are taken for `time=2015` and `geo` as any country/zone already present in `LI01` 
at the exception of AT, BE and EU28.

See `%%_example_silc_ind_working` for more examples.

### Notes
The following rules apply:
	* when none of `geo` and `time` parameters are passed, the structure of the table (_i.e._, its fields)
	are simply reproduced in `odsn`:

	    PROC SQL;
		   CREATE TABLE WORK.&odsn like &ilib..&idsn; 
	    quit; 
	* when `geo` parameter is passed but not `time`, all countries not represented in `geo` are retrieved
	for all years present in the dataset:

	    PROC SQL;
			CREATE TABLE WORK.&odsn  AS
			SELECT * FROM &ilib..&idsn 
			WHERE geo not in %list_quote(&geo);
	    quit; 
	* when `time` parameter is passed but not `geo`, all countries are retrieved for the given 
	year `time`:

        PROC SQL;
		    CREATE TABLE WORK.&odsn  AS
		    SELECT * FROM &ilib..&idsn 
		    WHERE time = &time;
	    quit; 
	* when both parameters `geo` and `time` are passed, all countries not represented in `geo` are retrieved 
	for the given year `time`.

	    PROC SQL;
			CREATE TABLE WORK.&odsn  AS
			SELECT * FROM &ilib..&idsn 
			WHERE geo not in %list_quote(&geo) and time = &time;
	    quit;
